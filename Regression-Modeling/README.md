## 📈 Demographic Income Prediction — Regression & Multiple Regression Analysis

**Overview:**
This project applies simple and multiple regression modeling to investigate how education levels and voting behavior relate to median income across U.S. congressional districts using 2016 demographic data. The analysis identifies how socioeconomic and political factors interact to explain variation in regional income.

**Methods:**

- Performed simple linear regression using one predictor (Percent voting for Clinton).

- Extended to multiple regression with two predictors (College% and Percent voting for Clinton).

- Computed correlation coefficients, slopes, and intercepts to quantify linear relationships.

- Used RMSE minimization to evaluate and compare model accuracy.

- Visualized results with Matplotlib and Plotly scatter plots, including 3D regression surfaces.

**Conclusion:**
Both education and voting trends show meaningful associations with income, with college attainment emerging as a stronger predictor of median income across districts.
